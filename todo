- DONE - integrated Sabin's branch into my branch and allow it to run on LC
    * had to move things around, change permissions, change js and css references, and some other stuff
- DONE - now able to send JSONP -> /usr/gapps/spot/optvis/optparser.py open /g/g0/pascal/a.out via the GET button and input on the left.
- DONE - Stubs for the request (until we can get the real data back)

1. Show a file in the view that the user selects
    * needs to send an AJAX request fetch the file needed.
3. Load the 3 stubs into our loadFile_
4. Get findLoops requests working without flask
    * partly working.  Request is sent but nothing get sent back.
5. do a custom virtualenv for this application: currently we're using the narf one i created.

Installing flask
pip install flask

Running the server:
- From the terminal, cd to the root directory of optvis (i.e. the directory where server.py is located)
- Then run the following commands

$ export FLASK_APP=server.py
$ python -m flask run

It should run a webserver. The main page can accessed using the following URL.

http://localhost:5000/optvis/

For more details, I find this quick start guide useful https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/. Thanks.

1. attempt to install FLASK on LC VM.  if that doesn't work we'll have to figure out a work around for the Flask.
    * flask stuff is in server.py
    * sabin will send me the commands he's using to install flask
    * he uses the url: http://localhost:5000/optvis/
