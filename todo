DONE 1. iterate through all contentItems tree and find thing we're looking for, and remove it.
DONE 2. render menu with checkboxes
DONE 3. uncheckbox -> extract name of content item and call removal function
DONE 4. checkboxed -> extract name of content item and call addChild with with hard coded location
DONE 5. open and close render menu.
DONE 6. every time a tab is closed, need to update the checkbox so it reflects that closure.
DONE 6.5 get rid of redundant x button on the right.
DONE - SubEnterExec    8. Rebind SubEnterExec when it comes back.
- ??? try to return to original position.
TEST - Reinitializing.  When a program has already been loaded, will the removed panels that have been re-added still work?



More FE things to debug.  Here’s a binary from the intel compiler (previous one was gcc):
/usr/gapps/spot/optvis/tests/raja/build_intel_toss_3_x86_64_ib/bin/ltimes.

After clicking on ltimes.cpp line 144:

- The FE goes unresponsive for a minute or so after opening this.  Can you look for some optimization opportunities?
    * dissasemblyView: Line 192.
    * something is replacing the var names.
    0x401180: call 0xfffffe30(%rip) 1, 0
    0x401185: mov $0xa,%edx
    0x40118a: lea 0x1fc1(%rip),%rsi
DONE - The FnLoops panel’s horizontal scrollbar is width limited.  So I can’t see the names of routines that are too far right.
- The CFG panel is still blank for me.  I clicked in it to scroll and seem to have hung up the whole FE for a couple minutes.


Later (very difficult)
    * remember location and index of each place where a tab gets removed.
    * use location and index to AddChild to precise location where it was taken from.
    * Corner case: if that parent no longer exists place it in the first tab section.




high = myLayout.root.contentItems[ 0 ].contentItems[0].contentItems[1]
myLayout.root.contentItems[0].contentItems[0].removeChild(high)

#  for this use configs in main_with_mvc_goldenlayouts.js
myLayout.root.contentItems[0].contentItems[0].addChild(high.config)


- can we just disable the close winodw?  it might be much easier.
- reopen the closed windows.
    1. Be able to get list of windows using goldenlayouts API
        * start with myLayout and use some function to retrieve list of windows.
        * Open drop down menu from top left and show a list of checkboxes for every window, and show checked if it's open, unchecked if not open
        * found myLayout.config but it's not up to date!

    2. if they click on a checkbox that is checked then close that window: removeChild( contentItem, true )
    3. if unchecked then open that window.  addChild()
    4. if they close a window through other means, update dropdown.
        * or just close the dropdown selector and regenerate it, when they reopen it.
    5. if they open a new window, update dropdown.


DONE - update the Optvis live with Sabin's new code, plus any integration and merge issues.
- perhaps later on: being able to define "/g/g0/pascal/input", root path because this path could be incorrect.
- StateManagement (started)
    * Left Off: get 'stateChanged' event working.


============================================================================================
DONE - Go from using the 3 stubs to actually getting a response back from the Server via matt's executables.
DONE - put the enter executable input dir modal in it's own panel in the left upper view but take the space out of VarRenamer.

DONE - fix input source - it should come from what's actually in the input box, not hard coded.
DONE - add a spinner to let user know something is running.
DONE - Notes: Remember to compile with -g so that the sourcefiles will be returned.

Next:
DONE - get Jira board working and give Sabin and Myself 1 ticket each.
DONE - Need better error reporting.  Show the user the error clearly whatever is returned from BE.
DONE - Permission script for better environment set up.


DONE - Solved a difficult venv issue (LC had moved a bunch of stuff that broke my existing venv)
    * now we have a brand new venv that we can install stuff into (not reusing the narf one)
    * plus documentation on how to create the venv.
DONE - this fixes the linking source code to callgraph: fixed the static stub loading to switch to dynamic name of the source file.  Instead of using a hardcoded filename, it will now use a dynamic filename based on what you select.
        - connecting sourceCode to callgraph fixed (with Sabin's suggestion of fixing the stub).

============================================================================
DONE - RZ Deploy is finished.
DONE - Start with a blank application, not Lulesh.
    * try helloworld and manually cut out the json so it looks empty.
    * maybe just blank panes.

============================================================================

DONE - update the Optvis live with Sabin's new code, plus any integration and merge issues.
    - Fix empty loading - one of sabin's changes must have loaded a default.
(started) - StateManagement
    * Left Off: get 'stateChanged' event working.


Later:
- TreeView -> to sort all those source files.



- GoldenLayouts -> State Management.
    * there's a config file,
    * GoldenLayouts.


- text size change
- Work on the display issues: why is the boxes getting bigger with each click
    * figured out it's coming from the graphlibDot library, can override?  or find the true source.
- Display issue: why is it jumping around to the left and right.

/usr/global/web-pages/lc/www/lorenz_base/dev/pascal/optvis/sample_inputs/3/

Sabin Next:
- Work on linking source code to the Callgraph.


Later On:
Use a Source Tree to show the source files in the top left.


-> may want to clean this up every now and then: ls /tmp/opt*
    * use rm to clean it up, if it's not already cleaned up.



- DONE - integrated Sabin's branch into my branch and allow it to run on LC
    * had to move things around, change permissions, change js and css references, and some other stuff
- DONE - now able to send JSONP -> /usr/gapps/spot/optvis/optparser.py open /g/g0/pascal/a.out via the GET button and input on the left.
- DONE - Stubs for the request (until we can get the real data back)

- DONE - Show a file in the view that the user selects
    - DONE - needs to send an AJAX request fetch the file needed.
3. Load files the user requested into it's own window View box.
4. Load the 3 stubs into our loadFile_
4.5  Make a better stub a.out that's at least got a couple of function calls.
5. Get findLoops requests working without flask
    * partly working.  Request is sent but nothing get sent back.
8. do a custom virtualenv for this application: currently we're using the narf one i created.

Installing flask
pip install flask

Running the server:
- From the terminal, cd to the root directory of optvis (i.e. the directory where server.py is located)
- Then run the following commands

$ export FLASK_APP=server.py
$ python -m flask run

It should run a webserver. The main page can accessed using the following URL.

http://localhost:5000/optvis/

For more details, I find this quick start guide useful https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/. Thanks.

1. attempt to install FLASK on LC VM.  if that doesn't work we'll have to figure out a work around for the Flask.
    * flask stuff is in server.py
    * sabin will send me the commands he's using to install flask
    * he uses the url: http://localhost:5000/optvis/
