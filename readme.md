# OptVis: Visualization of Binary Code

OptVis takes as input the source file, dot file, and the JSON analysis file generated by optparser.

OptVis uses JS for the frontend and flask (python) for the backend.

## Requirements:
flask

## Sample input files
The sample input files for the application can be found in the `static` directory. The files are generated using the [lulesh](https://github.com/LLNL/lulesh) benchmark code. The sample files are `lulesh.cc`, `lulesh.o.dot`, and `lulesh.o.json`. 

# Installation:
## Set up Docker.
Sample Set up:

```bash
docker build -t optvis_aa .
```

Every time you run the following command, you will need to increment c1: c2, c3, etc.

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000/tcp optvis_aa
```

Once you get this running, you enter this in the browser address bar:
http://localhost:5000/

By default, the dockerfile will build an executable sample file for basic testing: `/home/ccnavuser/a3.out`, so this can be used for testing inside the docker run.

Look at the top left panel of your browser window.  
For the executable input dir, enter the following: `/home/ccnavuser/a3.out`

Then click the "Get" button.

# Usage:
## Development mode
For development, we need to name the docker run to access it later. We can do this by:
```bash
docker run --name optvis_run -p 5000:5000/tcp optvis_aa
```

```bash
docker exec -it optvis_run /bin/bash
```

__You may need to delete the docker container before running it again. Or you can use different name each time you run in development mode.__
