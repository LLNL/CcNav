# OptVis: Visualization of Binary Code

OptVis takes as input the source file, dot file, and the JSON analysis file generated by optparser.

OptVis uses JS for the frontend and flask (python) for the backend.

## Requirements:
Flask

Install flask using the following command: 
`pip install Flask`
[Installing Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#install-flask)

# Running the code
```
export FLASK_APP=server.py
python -m flask run
```

The application runs on `http://localhost:5000/optvis/` 

## Sample input files
The sample input files for the application can be found in the `static` directory. The files are generated using the [lulesh](https://github.com/LLNL/lulesh) benchmark code. The sample files are `lulesh.cc`, `lulesh.o.dot`, and `lulesh.o.json`. 





Potential problems:
suexec failure: could not open log file., referer: https://lc.llnl.gov/lorenz_base/dev/pascal/optvis/

Answer:
This means that you need to point the GetFileChoices.cgi script to the correct python virtualenvironment:
#!/usr/global/tools/lorenz/python/narf-env/bin/python

It could also mean that the persmissions are not correct:
These work:
-rwx------ 1 pascal pascal 220 Nov 15 16:26 GetFileChoices.cgi
-rwx------ 1 pascal pascal 253 Nov 15 16:26 SubmitFileChoices.cgi

This does not work:
-rw------- 1 pascal pascal 222 Nov 19 11:03 findLoops.cgi
