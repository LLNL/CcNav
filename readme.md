# OptVis: Visualization of Binary Code

OptVis takes as input the source file, dot file, and the JSON analysis file generated by optparser.

OptVis uses JS for the frontend and flask (python) for the backend.

## Requirements:
Flask

Install flask using the following command: 
`pip install Flask`
[Installing Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#install-flask)

# Running the code
```
export FLASK_APP=server.py
python -m flask run
```

The application runs on `http://localhost:5000/optvis/` 

## Sample input files
The sample input files for the application can be found in the `static` directory. The files are generated using the [lulesh](https://github.com/LLNL/lulesh) benchmark code. The sample files are `lulesh.cc`, `lulesh.o.dot`, and `lulesh.o.json`.
