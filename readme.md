# Project Name: CCNAV
LLNL-CODE- 826840


# Description:



# Table of Contents: 


# Installation:
## Set up Docker.
Sample Set up:

docker build -t optvis_aa .

Every time you run the following command, you will need to increment c1: c2, c3, etc.
docker run -v "/Users/aschwanden1/optvis/:/code/CcNav/"  -p 5000:5000/tcp --name c1 optvis_aa

Once you get this running, you enter this in the browser address bar:
http://localhost:5000/

By default, the dockerfile will build an executable sample file for basic testing: a3.out
it is built by this command: 
RUN gcc  -g /home/ccnavuser/CcNav/misc/sample_inputs/a0/hello.c -o /home/ccnavuser/a3.out

Then look at the top left panel of your browser window.  
For the executable input dir, enter the following:
/home/ccnavuser/a3.out

Then click the "Get" button.

If you need to debug your application, you can do so from the command line with the following:
docker exec -it c1 /bin/bash

Notice that "c1" has to match the above docker run command.

Notes:
# OptVis: Visualization of Binary Code

OptVis takes as input the source file, dot file, and the JSON analysis file generated by optparser.

OptVis uses JS for the frontend and flask (python) for the backend.

## Requirements:
Flask

Install flask using the following command: 
`pip install Flask`
[Installing Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#install-flask)

# Running the code
```
export FLASK_APP=server.py
python -m flask run
```

The application runs on `http://localhost:5000/optvis/` 

## Sample input files
The sample input files for the application can be found in the `static` directory. The files are generated using the [lulesh](https://github.com/LLNL/lulesh) benchmark code. The sample files are `lulesh.cc`, `lulesh.o.dot`, and `lulesh.o.json`.
